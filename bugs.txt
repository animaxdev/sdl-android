Known bugs
==========

- With 4:3 screen aspect ratio the on-screen buttons are not shown on the inactive part of screen.

- Put video at the center of the screen with 4:3 aspect ratio option

- Calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with SDL 1.3 several times makes it crash.

- Calling SDL_Init()/SDL_Quit() several times will make SDL 1.2 crash.

- SDL_FillRect() does not work with SDL 1.2 in HW mode (and probably with SDL 1.3 too).

- 32-bpp color mode does not work with SW video surface, 24-bpp and 32-bpp mode does not work with SDL_HWSURFACE.

Requested features
==================

- Perform a check for free space available on SD card before writing there, and write to the internal storage if SD card is unplugged.

- Split Settings.java into several files

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- Support of libjnigraphics (it will disable on-screen keyboard, only SW SDL screen surface supported)

- Floating on-screen joystick - initially invisible, it appears when you touch the screen,
  centered on your finger, then it slides with your finger if you bump the joystick edge.

- Export phone vibrator to SDL - interface is available in SDL 1.3

- Control screen brightness with SDL_SetGamma()

- Zoom in-out whole screen in SW mode with some SDL key -
  much like the "On-screen magnifying glass" feature (lazy porter's golden hammer)
